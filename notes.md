# initial notes

EOL Syntax -> .
File Extension -> .erl

## Compile ERL
- Move to the dir the file is
- Open erlang shell
- execute the below
``` c(filename) ```

## Things to Explore
- What is the difference between ; and . ?
- Is overloading a function supported using Atoms (Atoms are simply names that help erlang compiler identify the difference between two methods with the same name and data type)
- What are datatypes in erlang? (Haven't seen even a single one. Yet)
